"""
Distance calculation API endpoints for the Delivery Distance Tracker.

This module provides REST API endpoints for distance calculation between addresses:

Endpoints:
- POST /distance: Calculate distance between two addresses with geocoding and storage

Request/Response Flow:
1. Validate request using DistanceQueryRequest schema
2. Process through DistanceService business logic
3. Return DistanceQueryResponse with all calculation details
4. Handle errors with appropriate HTTP status codes

Error Mapping:
- 400 Bad Request: Geocoding failures (address not found)
- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Validation errors (malformed requests)
- 503 Service Unavailable: External API unavailable (Nominatim down)
- 500 Internal Server Error: Database/internal errors

Security Features:
- Request validation prevents injection attacks
- Address sanitization in service layer
- Error message sanitization (no internal details exposed)
- Rate limiting through geocoding service

Performance:
- Async request processing
- Concurrent geocoding operations
- Efficient database transactions
- Proper resource cleanup

    Calculate distance between two addresses.

    This endpoint processes distance calculation requests by:
    1. Validating input addresses using Pydantic schema validation
    2. Geocoding both addresses using the Nominatim API
    3. Calculating the distance using the Haversine formula
    4. Storing the complete query in the database
    5. Returning detailed results including coordinates and metadata

    Args:
        request: Distance calculation request with source and destination addresses
        distance_service: Injected distance service for business logic processing

    Returns:
        JSONResponse: Detailed distance calculation results including:
            - id: Database record ID for the query
            - source_address: Cleaned source address
            - destination_address: Cleaned destination address
            - source_lat/lng: Source coordinates from geocoding
            - destination_lat/lng: Destination coordinates from geocoding
            - source_coords: [lat, lng] array for source
            - destination_coords: [lat, lng] array for destination
            - distance_km: Calculated distance in kilometers
            - created_at: Timestamp of the query

    Raises:
        HTTPException 400: Geocoding failed (address not found)
        HTTPException 422: Validation error (invalid input format)
        HTTPException 503: External service unavailable (Nominatim API down)
        HTTPException 500: Internal error (database or calculation failure)

    Example Request:
        ```json
        {
            "source_address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA",
            "destination_address": "1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino, CA"
        }
        ```

    Example Response:
        ```json
        {
            "id": 123,
            "source_address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA",
            "destination_address": "1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino, CA",
            "source_lat": 37.4224764,
            "source_lng": -122.0842499,
            "destination_lat": 37.3349,
            "destination_lng": -122.009,
            "source_coords": [37.4224764, -122.0842499],
            "destination_coords": [37.3349, -122.009],

        }
        ```

    Performance Notes:
        - Geocoding operations run concurrently for optimal response time
        - Database operations use transactions with automatic rollback
        - Response times typically 1-3 seconds depending on geocoding API

    Security Notes:
        - All addresses are validated and sanitized before processing
        - Error messages sanitized to prevent information disclosure
        - Rate limiting applied through geocoding service
